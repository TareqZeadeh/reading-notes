# Structure
### -Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents.
### -In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.
### -In order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.
## -HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages :
### -To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.

```
<html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
```



### -The HTML code  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML **Elements**.
### -Elements are usually made up of two **tags** , opening tag and closing tag (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.).
### -Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

## -Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
1. #### The opening _html_ tag indicates that anything between it and a closing /html tag is HTML code.
2. #### The _body_ tag indicates that anything between it and the closing _/body_ tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
3. #### Words between _h1_ and _/h1_ are a main heading.
4. #### A paragraph of text appears between these _p_ and _/p_ tags.
5. #### Words between _h2_ and -/h2_ form a sub-heading.
6. #### The closing _/body_ tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
7. #### The closing _/html_ tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

## -Attributes Tell Us More About Elements.
#### -Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.
#### -Attributes appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts , **name** and **value**, separated by an equals sign.
#### -The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content.
#### -The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes.
#### -The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes can appear on any element.
#### -Most attribute values are either pre-deﬁned or follow a stipulated format.
