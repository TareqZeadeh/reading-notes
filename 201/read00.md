# Structure
### -Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents.
### -In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.
### -In order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.
## -HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages :
### -To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
```
<html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
