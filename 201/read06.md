# Domain Modeling
### Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
### A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.
### Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.
1. #### When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. #### Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. #### Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. #### Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. #### Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. #### Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
# Tables
### What is the table?
#### A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
#### Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
#### Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects.
### Creating many objectes:Constructor notation"
#### 1. Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.
#### 2. You create instances of the object using the constr~uctor function. The new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object. The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.
#### You might use this technique if your script contains a vary complex object that needs to be available but might not be used. The object is defined in the function, but it is only created if it is needed.
