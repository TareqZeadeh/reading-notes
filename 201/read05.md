# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming:
## Why problem domains are hard?
### Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain. The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all

## Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.
### What can you do about it?
#### If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:
1. Make the problem domain easier.
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.
### You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

# What is an object?
## Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
### IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES.
### IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS.
