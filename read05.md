# Control Flow.
**The control flow isthe order in which the computer executes statements in a script.**
**Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops like _if...else_.**

**A typical script in JavaScript includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.**

# JavaScript Operators.
**JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.**
**example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.**

### JavaScript includes following categories of operators.
1. Arithmetic Operators.
2. Comparison Operators.
3. Logical Operators.
4. Assignment Operators.
5. Conditional Operators.
