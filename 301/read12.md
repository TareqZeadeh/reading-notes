##### 1.Called as non-relational or distributed database.

##### 3.Have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
##### 4.Horizontally scalable.
##### 5.Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). 

## 2.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
