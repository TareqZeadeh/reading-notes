# Java Script operators and Expressions.
## Operators Types :
### 1. Assignment operators : An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 
### 2. Comparison operators : A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. 
### 3. Arithmetic operators :An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. 
### 4. Bitwise operators : A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. 
### 5. Logical operators : Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.
### 6. String operators : In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
### 7. Conditional (ternary) operator : The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition. The syntax is: ### condition ? val1 : val2.
### 8. Comma operator : The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.
### 9. Unary operators : A unary operation is an operation with only one operand , like _delete , typeof , void_ .
### 10. Relational operators :A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

## Operator precedence :
### The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator precedence by using parentheses.


## Expressions :
### An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

### Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

# Loops .
## Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
## The statements for loops provided in JS are :

### 1. for statement.
### 2. do...while statement.
### 3. labeled statement.
### 4. continue statement.
### 5. while statement.
### 6. break statement.
### 7. for...in statement.
### 8. for...of statement.
