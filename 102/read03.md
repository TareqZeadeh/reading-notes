# How to build your own website
### To build your own website, there are several important requirements and steps that you need to know. First, we start with the requirements:
1. Create Your Wireframe.
2. Learn about HTML basics.
3. Learn about Semantics.

**1-Create Wireframe:**
### Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. 
**You can create your wierframe by _six Necessary_ steps:**
1. Do your research.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference.
3.  Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
4.   Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5.   Add some detail and get testing.
6.   Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.


**2-HTML Basics:**
##### HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. Simply, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its contentز

**3- Semantics:**
#####  In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".).
### Semantics in HTML :
##### In HTML, for example, the _h1_ element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
  ### Semantics in CSS :
  ##### In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?.
  ### Semantics in JavaScript :
  ##### In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an _li element_ with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?.
